# 🧭 OpenFocus  

### 🚀 Overview  
**OpenFocus** is a web app designed to help **Ohio State University students** quickly find open, quiet study spaces on campus. During peak hours, finding an available spot to study can be frustrating and time-consuming.  
OpenFocus solves this by displaying **real-time crowd levels** across study areas — helping students save time and stay productive.  

We built this project in under **24 hours** at **HackOH/IO 2025**, combining our skills in frontend, backend, and cloud technologies to deliver a smooth, data-driven experience.

### 💡 Problem  
Existing tools like the **OSU room reservation system** are limited — they only show reserved rooms and don’t reflect actual room usage or availability. Many “reserved” rooms sit empty, while open ones appear “full.”  

**OpenFocus** bridges this gap by providing **live, crowd-sourced data** on which study spots are crowded and which are open, displayed on an **interactive campus map**.
