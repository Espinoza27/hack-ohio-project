# OpenFocus
Overview
OpenFocus is a web app designed to help Ohio State University students quickly find open, quiet study spaces on campus. During peak hours, finding an available spot to study can be frustrating and time-consuming. OpenFocus solves this by displaying real-time crowd levels across study areas — helping students save time and stay productive.
We built this project in under 24 hours at HackOH/IO 2025, combining our skills in frontend, backend, and cloud technologies to deliver a smooth, data-driven experience.
Problem
Existing tools like the OSU room reservation system are limited — they only show reserved rooms and don’t reflect actual room usage or availability. Many “reserved” rooms sit empty, while open ones appear “full.”
OpenFocus bridges this gap by providing live, crowd-sourced data on which study spots are crowded and which are open, displayed on an interactive campus map.
