OPEN FOCUS

Create digital map of floor of some building

Possible extension: Get locations of user's by our project being an extension of OSU app and use
the already created annonomuys location tracking instead of having to 
create a whole new infrastructure

Make app that askes for location

can make private or public study sessions with room number and subject being studied
dependent on building

each public and private study session can have a communcation room or chat room

PROFILE
name, major, classes currently taking stored by class number

APP HOME SCREEN
-Has live updating map on one side that shows popular study zones and red, yellow, green
dependent on how occupied it is
-Red, Yellow, Green zones dependent on set number of people that fills a building
Ex: thomspon at max capacity when a lot of people are there and most study spots will
be taken is around lets say 800 people, then base red zones on 700-800 people there,
yellow on 
-For protoype we would have one floor of thompson
-lists suggested study sessions on that floor dependent on PROFILE

PUBLIC/PRIVATE STUDY SESSION ROOMS
-Public would have open availability to join where a chat is availble to communicate with
people within the study session
-Private sessions - in progress / only way to get this info would be to get data from OSU
